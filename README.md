## My process

I start with the structure of the html, after i had that i start adding styles as i need them, i think that made up the code in the styles look a little messy, in the process of doing that i was also creating new classes and id, the last part was creating the hover effects, and a little
tweaking of the dimensions after that.
Note - i tried to do a mobile first aproach, i never do anything like it, so i dont know if it was right or wrong.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I really like this proyect to practice some html and css, and it help realize that i need much more practice with the structure of the page
like when to do an ID or a CLASS. In the end ir turn out a little messy but i think it has the same look as the preview image.
And i strugle a little with the hover on the image, at first i didnt know how to do it, but in the end i came up with an idea.

### Continued development

I would keep trying to figure it out how to make a better structure in html. And make a better decicion in the way i make the classes and ids.
And also tying to learn more about variable units (i know some about them), i didnt use them in this proyect.
